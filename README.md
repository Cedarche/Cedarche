I'm a hardworking mechanical engineer with 5+ years of experience in the Natural Gas industry as a project manager, and 6+ years of part-time experience in the construction industry. I've recently moved to London and I'm looking to change careers into software engineering as that's where my passion really lies.

Over the past 4 years, I've spent much of my spare time learning and building out various ideas and software projects. While I realize that most of my experience lends itself to more mechanical roles, I'm hoping my portfolio of React/React-Native projects might be enough to convince you.
