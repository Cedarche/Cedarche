Hi, I'm Tom. 

Although I am a mechanical project engineer by profession, my true interest lies in software/hardware development. As a self-taught developer, I have built and led several significant projects, both commercially and personally over the past 4+ years.

You can see some of my projects below: 

- **[Snap Park](https://snappark.co)** - Have you ever arrived at work, driven up multiple levels of a
            parking garage, only to find that all your office's allocated spots
            have been taken? Me too, so I decided to build a tool to help
            companies keep track of their parking spaces, and to notify
            employees when the office is full.
- **[Ream](https://reamreceipts.com)** - is an end-to-end digital receipt system aimed at both enterprises and consumers. It consists of Web & Native Mobile applications, and a hardware component, the Ream Tile, for which I designed the PCB and housing from the ground up.
- **[Cross Copy](https://crosscopy.dev/)** - is a simply cross-platform application I built to quickly transfer text and files without the hassel or complexity of Dropbox or Google Drive. You can share photos, videos, and files natively on your mobile device - then instantly access them on any of your other devices.
- **Assetrix** - is an internal asset tracking system that uses QR Codes to track the location, P&ID, ISO number for industrial equipment. It was built specifically for a client at my previous job in order to keep track of the decomissioning of a complex gas compressor station and is still in use today.
- **Stellarmetrics** - is a remote monitoring solution for assets in rural areas, it utilises the SWARM satellite network to send small packets of data (tank water levels, pressure readings, etc.) for a fraction of the cost of traditional systems - currently in development.
